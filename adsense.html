        <h4>Description</h4>
        <article>
            <p>AdSense is a popular advertising network that allows website owners and publishers to monetize their
                content by displaying ads provided by Google.</p>
            <p>There are several alternatives to Google AdSense, and the
                choice of which one to use depends on your
                specific needs and preferences. Below mentioned some very popular alternatives to AdSense
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3>Website ads are used for various purposes:</h3>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Generating Revenue:
                </strong>
                Many websites rely on ad revenue as a primary or supplementary source of income. Website owners can
                partner with ad networks, like Google AdSense, to display ads on their site and earn money based on
                impressions, clicks, or conversions.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Promoting Products and Services:
                </strong>
                Businesses use website ads to showcase their products or services to a targeted audience. These ads can
                lead to increased sales and brand visibility.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Driving Traffic:
                </strong>
                Ads can be used to drive traffic to specific landing pages, articles, or other parts of a website,
                helping to increase user engagement and interaction.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Building Brand Awareness:
                </strong>
                Banner and display ads are often used to build brand awareness and recognition among a wide online
                audience.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Retargeting:
                </strong>
                Advertisers use cookies and user data to display ads to users who have previously visited their website.
                This is known as retargeting and aims to re-engage potential customers.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Monetizing Content:
                </strong>
                Content creators, such as bloggers and YouTubers, can use ads to monetize their content and earn income
                from their audience.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's important to strike a balance when using website ads. Too many ads or intrusive ad placement can
                negatively impact user experience and drive visitors away from a website. Therefore, website owners
                should consider their target audience, ad formats, and ad placement carefully to ensure a positive user
                experience while achieving their advertising goals.
            </p>
